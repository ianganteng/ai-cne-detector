# ai-cne-detector

AiCNE is an ai course project in my 3rd semester with my group. In short, our model in this project can classify the user's facial condition consisting of 3 classes using deep learning technology. In this project my task is to  design the aicne website in figma and working on the acne detection model. We have tried using several models such as ResNet50, VGG19, but the one that got the highest results was the InceptionV3 model with a fairly high training accuracy of 0.9353 and validation accuracy of 0.921875
